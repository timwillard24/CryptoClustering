# Crypto Clustering

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for clustering cryptocurrencies based on provided market data. 
The notebook leverages machine learning techniques to identify distinct groups within the cryptocurrency market.

## Dependencies
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## 1. Data Preprocessing

- **Loading Data**: The notebook starts by loading the cryptocurrency market data from a CSV file.
- **Cleaning Data**: Various data cleaning steps are performed to handle missing values and prepare the data for analysis.

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Visualization**: The notebook includes visualizations to explore the distribution and relationships of the data features.

## 3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining most of the variance.

## 4. K-Means Clustering

- **Elbow Method**: The Elbow Method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- **Clustering**: K-Means clustering is applied to the dataset, and the resulting clusters are analyzed.

## 5. Visualizing Results

- **2D Scatter Plot**: The clustered data is visualized using a 2D scatter plot based on the principal components.
